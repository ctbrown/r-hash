\title{creates/coerces objects to proper hash keys}
\usage{
make.keys(key)
}
\arguments{
\item{key}{An object that represents the key(s) to be coerced to a valid
hash keys.}
}
\value{
A character vector of valid keys/names
}
\description{
Given an vector of any type, \code{make.keys} tries to coerce it into a
character vector that can be used as a hash key.  This is used internally by
the hash package and should not be normally needed.  It is \emph{not}
exported.
}
\details{
This function is used internally by the \code{\link[=hash]{hash()}} class to ensure
that the keys are valid. There should be no need to use this externally and
is only documented for completeness.
}

  make.keys( letters )
